# Improvements

## Improvement 1: Make Test Data in SQL Statements Dynamic

- **How?**  
  Replace hardcoded SQL data in test cases with dynamic data generation. Instead of embedding static SQL statements, leverage methods or configurations to generate data dynamically based on the test’s context. This can be done by:
    - Using parameters or variables within SQL statements to adapt values for each test case.
    - Creating a utility function that prepares and inserts random or contextually relevant data before each test.
    - Fetching data from external files or using a data provider method to generate SQL statements dynamically.

- **Why?**  
  Dynamic SQL data generation enables more flexible and reusable tests that adapt to various scenarios. This approach reduces dependency on specific data values, making tests less brittle and better suited to verify different cases without extensive modifications.

- **Benefits**  
  - Increases the range and adaptability of test cases, covering more edge cases.
  - Reduces hard-coded dependencies on specific data values, enhancing maintainability.
  - Improves test reliability by ensuring data setup matches each test scenario’s requirements.
  - Allows for testing with randomized or parametrized data, better simulating real-world conditions.

## Improvement 2: Abstract SQL Statements into Helper Functions or Scripts

- **How?**  
  Move SQL statements out of test annotations and into helper functions or SQL scripts. For instance:
    - Store SQL setup commands in external `.sql` files, and execute these scripts as part of test setup.
    - Create a utility class or method that assembles SQL statements programmatically based on input parameters (e.g., user names, item types).
    - Consider using an ORM or database abstraction layer to manage data setup for testing purposes, if feasible within the project’s technology stack.

- **Why?**  
  Centralizing SQL commands in helper functions or scripts improves test readability and reduces duplication. This approach also streamlines test setup changes: updates to SQL commands or data structures can be done in one place, making the tests easier to maintain.

- **Benefits**  
  - Reduces code duplication, as common SQL statements are extracted into reusable components.
  - Simplifies test maintenance, as SQL commands are managed separately from test logic.
  - Enhances readability, allowing test code to focus more on logic than data preparation.

## Improvement 3: Use Database Seeding Techniques for Test Data Setup

- **How?**  
  Implement a seeding mechanism to populate test data in the database. Use seed files, configurations, or environment-specific initializers to set up data. This could involve:
    - Running pre-defined seed scripts for essential data before running tests.
    - Using a dedicated test database that is reset and seeded before each test suite or individual test.

- **Why?**  
  Database seeding is a robust way to set up initial conditions for testing. It ensures that tests have a known, clean state and allows the use of more complex data structures. Additionally, seeding simplifies test setup by managing data preparation outside of individual test cases.

- **Benefits**  
  - Provides a reliable baseline for test data across multiple test cases.
  - Reduces the likelihood of test failures due to inconsistent data setups.
  - Improves test speed by managing data preparation efficiently, especially for larger datasets.
