# Improvements

## Improvement 1: Add a Pipeline to Trigger Tests Automatically

- **How?**  
  Implement an automated CI pipeline to run tests on each code push or pull request. Depending on the teamâ€™s tech stack, GitHub Actions is a great choice for this setup, as it integrates seamlessly with GitHub.

- **Why?**  
  Automating test execution shortens the feedback loop, allowing developers to identify and address issues earlier in the development cycle. Faster feedback helps to catch bugs sooner and maintain higher code quality.

- **Benefits**  
  - Ensures consistency by running tests on every code change.
  - Minimizes manual effort and reduces the risk of skipping tests before merging changes.
  - Improves team productivity with faster validation of new code.

## Improvement 2: Move Header Elements to a Separate POM (Page Object Model) Class

- **How?**  
  Create a dedicated class for header components. This class can house all header-related selectors and actions, allowing the header to be treated as a reusable component.

- **Why?**  
  Isolating the header elements makes the test code more modular and reusable. Future tests will not need to add redundant home page objects when they only require the header. It also aligns with best practices in Page Object Model design by treating common components as modular parts.

- **Benefits**  
  - Increases reusability of the header across different pages.
  - Reduces code duplication, making the codebase easier to maintain.
  - Enhances readability and scalability of the test framework.

## Improvement 3: Use Dynamic Test Data

- **How?**  
  Drive tests using dynamic data, such as external test files located in a `test-data` folder or APIs to fetch data (e.g., artist names). Libraries like `faker` can also be used to generate randomized, realistic data where applicable.

- **Why?**  
  Dynamic data enhances test robustness and flexibility by validating functionality across a broader range of data sets. It enables tests to adapt and scale more effectively in different environments or scenarios.

- **Benefits**  
  - Increases the coverage and accuracy of tests by validating different data sets.
  - Allows for a more comprehensive verification of edge cases.
  - Reduces hard-coding of test values, simplifying updates and maintenance.

## Improvement 4: Move the `createToken` Method to the Utils

- **How?**  
  Relocate the `createToken` function to a utilities or `helperFunctions` folder to consolidate reusable functions. This utility can then be used to generate tokens or any other setup needs across tests.

- **Why?**  
  Centralizing utility functions, like `createToken`, streamlines the preparation of test environments. As the test suite expands, having pre-conditions like token generation in a central location minimizes redundancy.

- **Benefits**  
  - Enhances modularity by keeping helper functions separate from test logic.
  - Simplifies code reuse and maintenance by having a single source of truth for utility methods.
  - Improves test readability and setup consistency across different scenarios.
