# üëã Welcome to your SAS SDET Tech Assessment

Here we are asking you to complete some technical tasks to see what and how you would approach and implement a solution.

### üìÑ The Assignment

As an SDET you will be leaning on your experience in this technical assessment to help test this application, as you will see this application has zero testing at the moment and we need you to pick the tooling and also decide how an what to test and with which approach to use.

That being said, we do expect **a minimum of the following to be achieved** which is explained below.

#### üóÉÔ∏è File Structre Breakdown

    /frontend - TypeScript React Application
    /backend - Java Spring Boot Application

#### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Assignment 1 - E2E Test

We need you in the frontend codebase we need to ensure the critical path works, which has been defined in the frontend README. 

For this you can use whatever language or framework you like and use your experiance on the how you would implement these tests.

#### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Assignment 2 - Test Lower

You will now need to decide for this second part of the assessment to if you would prefer to complete it in either Java or Typescript. 

If you want to use Java please test the backend code, if you would like to use Typescript please test the frontend code.

Within either project ther are various unit and component/integration tests that need to be implemented as there are ZERO tests right now, please use your experiance on what to test and where.

#### ‚è∞ Timeframe

Estimated Time: 1-2 hours per assessment (maximum)

#### ‚è≥ Not enought time?

We understand that you won't be able to implement everything you'd like to get this application up to scratch, please document all your suggested improvements here in as much detail as possible.
Things to keep in mind

    Remember to structure and use your code efficiently as you would in a real life project.
    Think about the testing levels in the pyramid that could be used.
    What improvents if you were given more time you would look to implement.
